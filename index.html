                <p>This is my first project doing the Udacity Front
                    End Developer Nano Degree in June 2020.
                    It's aim is to demonstrate a basic blog layout using a grid-layout and flexboxes.
                    It also schould include some cards, buttons and links.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Structure-wise it consists of a header, a navigation bar, a main area as well as a footer.

                    <p>Well, to be honest: I don't know.<br>
                        Maybe because I'm curiose.<br>
                        Maybe because I feel like my last try with webdesign is from last century (anyone remembering
                        the 90s?).<br>
                        And to be honest: building a webpage with frames and a frameset maybe kind of outdated nowadays.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, that's that. <br>
                        And maybe I just want do learn something new.<br>
                        Something I can or cannot use in the future.<br>
                        We'll see...
